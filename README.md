# Black History Month and Text Use of JET Magazine

This directory contains Scripts for performing NER (Named Entity Recognition) using spaCy with historical magazine text.  
 
The magazine and month are consecutive, so there's an opportunity to see any changes over time. In this instance, I am choosing February as the month and the years 1993 to 2004. I'm using Jet magazine for this analysis. I will be focusing on person names, locations, and dates. The goal is to track the frequency and context of these entities from 1993 to 2004.
