# Project Overview 

  I will use the script provided for NER (Named Entity Recognition) code, but I will change most of the format to be tailored to my dataset. The magazine and month are consecutive, so there's an opportunity to see any changes over time. In this instance, I am choosing February as the month and the years 1951-1975. I'm using Jet magazine for this analysis. With the already structured dataset I have, and to track this language change over time, I will be focusing on person names, organizations, locations, and events.

  The goal is to track these entities' frequency and context from 1951 to 1975. For example, was an organization mentioned once and never again? Or, after a specific date, whose names were used more than others? These are the types of historical questions I am posing.
