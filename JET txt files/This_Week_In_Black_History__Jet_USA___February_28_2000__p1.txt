W.E.B. DuBois, teacher, editor, poet and scholar, was born on this day in Great Barrington, MA. William
Edward Burghardt DuBois was one of the most prominent and influential Black leaders of the 20th century.
He earned a bachelor's degree from Fisk University in Nashville, TN, in 1885. He later earned another
bachelors degree as well as a doctorate from Harvard University. He was one of the founding fathers of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). DuBois also served as the
organization's director of publications and the editor of Crisis magazine until 1934. He wrote numerous books
and literary works that supported his belief that Blacks as a whole had to cultivate their own aesthetic and
cultural values even as they made strides through social emancipation. Some of his works include The Souls
of Black Folk, The Negro, Darkwater, Dusk of Dawn and The World and Africa. He died at the age of 95 in
1963.
