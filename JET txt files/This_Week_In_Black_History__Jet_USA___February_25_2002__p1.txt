Emmett L. Ashford

became the first Black umpire in organized baseball when he was authorized to be a substitute ins the
Southwestern International League on this day. He went on to be hired by the American League in 1966.
Ashford had a booming voice and theatrical style that endeared him to fans. He did everything with a flourish,
from calling pitches to signaling players out or safe. Ashford used huge gestures, to the disdain of batters who
were called out on strikes or tagged out on slides. He retired as an umpire in 1970 to work as a public
relations representative for Major League Baseball. Ashford died of a heart attack at the age of 65 on March
1, 1980, in Marina del Ray, CA.

Washington University. He also graduated from the National War College in Washington, D.C., in 1973. At the
age of 20, Petersen became the first Black aviator in the history of the Marines. He flew over 300 combat
missions during his career in the U.S. Marines, including tours in Korea and Vietnam. He spent 38 years in the
Marine Corps before he retired in 1988 as commanding general of the Marine Development Educational
Command in Quantico, VA. In 1999 Petersen released his autobiography, Into the Tiger's Jaw: America's First
Black Marine Aviator. He currently serves as the chair of the board of directors of the National Marrow Donor
