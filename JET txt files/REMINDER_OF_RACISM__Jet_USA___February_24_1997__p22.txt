Southern Christian Leadership Conference/Women members and supporters gather in prayer around the
defaced monument of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo during a news conference in Hayneville, AL. The
monument was erected in 1991 to honor the memory of Liuzzo, a White Detroit house-wife who was killed by
members of the Ku Klux Klan in 1965 while assisting in the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march. Since
its erection, the monument has been defaced three times by vandals. The defacement will be removed, said
the SCLC/Women convener, Evelyn Lowery (right of the monument), but they will temporarily leave the
Confederate flag on the monument to serve as a reminder that racism still exists. Those in prayer with
Lowery include Johnny Carr (2nd, r), Montgomery Improvement Association director, and Marie Foster (r), a
civil rights activist.
