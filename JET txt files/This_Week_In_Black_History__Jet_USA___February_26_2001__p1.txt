February 24, 1964-

Muhammad Ali,

considered the greatest heavyweight champion of all time, won his first world heavyweight championship
title by defeating Sonny Liston during a fight on this day in Miami. Cassius Marcellus Clay, 22, as he was then
known, had irked many sensibilities with his flamboyant commentary on his looks and boxing prowess. But
he left his critics dumbfounded when he took his trainer Drew (Bundini) Brown's advice to "float like a
butterfly, sting like a bee," taunting and battering then-champion Liston. After six rounds, Liston couldn't
answer the bell for the seventh, and Ali became the 22nd world heavyweight champion.
